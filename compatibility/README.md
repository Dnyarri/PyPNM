# PyPNM - PPM and PGM image files reading and writing

## Compatibility test samples

Current folder contains PNM files, created with popular software (Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, XnView MP). Image attributes and software version are supposed to be obvious from file names.

Note that this folder content is not a part of [PyPNG](https://github.com/Dnyarri/PyPNM/) distribution and included here only for illustration purposes (i.e. showing different file headers and formatting used by actual software).
